CS-360 Module Eight Journal – Final Project Reflection

For my final project in CS-360, I developed a mobile inventory app that allows users to log in, manage inventory items, and send optional SMS notifications. The goal of the app was to create a simple, user-friendly system for tracking items, and to practice real mobile app development using best practices like clean UI design, input validation, and secure login.

The app was designed with the user in mind from the very beginning. I started by creating a clear and easy-to-navigate UI in Project Two. Users can log in, add new items to an inventory list, delete items, and view item details. I kept the design minimal and clean, using large buttons and simple layouts to make it easy for users to interact with the app. One feature I added to support the user experience was SMS messaging, which lets users receive a confirmation message after they add an item.

When I moved to the coding part in Project Three, I focused on building each feature step by step. I used Android Studio and Java, working with a local SQLite database to store login credentials and inventory data. I reused UI components from Project Two to make sure the final app looked and felt like my original design. I also made use of breakpoints and log statements to debug my code along the way, which helped me understand how each part was functioning in real time.

To test the app, I ran it through the Android emulator, making sure all user actions produced the correct results. I tested adding and deleting items, logging in, and even making sure input fields handled empty values properly. This testing process was important because it helped me find bugs early, like logic errors in my inventory list and unexpected behavior in the SMS feature.

One of the biggest challenges I faced was getting the SMS feature to work correctly without crashing the app. I had to look up how permissions work in Android and how to handle cases where the user doesn’t give permission. Once I figured it out, it felt great to see everything working smoothly.

The part of the app I’m most proud of is the login system. I was able to store usernames and passwords using SQLite and build a working login screen that checks user credentials securely. This shows how I can build real features that work with a local database, which is a big step forward in my skills.

Overall, this project gave me real experience with designing and building a mobile app from the ground up. I learned how important it is to plan out the UI, think about what the user needs, and test each piece of the app. I’m excited to add this to my GitHub portfolio and use it as a way to show future employers what I can do.
